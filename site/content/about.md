Hi there, I'm Brenda (again).

I'm from the Bay Area, but currently live in Boston, MA.

I spend all my time watching tv, reading mystery novels, and designing digital experiences.

I also love traveling - I'm going to London / Italy / Prague next, in case you were interested!

Oh hey, check out my [resume](/resume.pdf) while you're here.
